A TUI prototype was created to research whether the created product could facilitate music experimentation through curiosity-driven, playful and exploratory interactions.

The prototype consists of two Controllers and a dedicated Host device. The Controllers work by each having eight buttons, four low height potentiometers and an NFC reader the user can interact with, all connected to a Pico 1. By inserting NFC cards, each assigned an instrument, the user can use seven of the eight buttons to play notes, harmonically fitting together, using that instrument's sounds. The eighth button activates the NFC reader. The four potentiometers are used to change the volume, delay, reverb and an amp effect differing for the selected instrument. Furthermore, a display is used to show custom pixelart images of the selected instruments. Lastly, the Controller contains a power switch on the back, and a USB 2.0 Type B port handling communication to the Host and power supply.

All the previously mentioned components are soldered to a custom designed professionally manufactured PCB. The PCB has two layers allowing the buttons, potentiometers and display to be mounted on the top side facing the user, while the Pico 1 and other smaller electrically required components are mounted on the bottom.

The Controller's chassis is 3D printed in PLA and is designed to be modular. It consists of a plane with four corners with slits for mounting different side panels. Two of the side panels are plain, one side has a hole for inserting NFC cards and the last side has holes for the power switch and USB connector. Furthermore, the chassis contains a custom designed mounting mechanism for the NFC reader letting inserted NFC cards sit closely to it to ensure correct functionality. The chassis also contains four standoffs aligned with holes on the PCB, allowing the PCB to be mounted inside the chassis close to the top. Lastly, the chassis' lid is designed to align with the PCB's soldered components, having holes for the buttons, potentiometers and display. The lid has a decorative design, with music notes and swirls. There are also custom 3D printed knobs mounted on the potentiometers and keycaps on the buttons. 

The Host is assembled on a breadboard, consisting of a Pico 2 connected to two NeoPixel LEDs used for debugging. The Host is also connected to the Controllers via USB 2.0 Type A to B cables. Furthermore, the Host is connected to a computer running Live. The Host communicates with the Controllers using IÂ²C, receiving messages regarding users' interactions, processing them, converting them to MIDI and sending them to Live. It is Live's job to receive the MIDI messages and convert them to audio.

A 3D printed enclosure is made for the Host to stabilize the breadboard and USB type A connectors. The lid on the enclosure has the text "HOST" with a hole in the 'O' to see the NeoPixel LEDs.
