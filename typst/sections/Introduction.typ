Music creation and engagement have been shown to have a range of positive effects on cognitive and emotional development in children. Studies indicate that exposure to music can enhance general intelligence, spatial reasoning, fine motor coordination, literacy skills, and self-perception @hallam_power_2010 @jaschke_music_2013. These findings highlight the value of music not only as a form of artistic expression but also as a powerful tool for developmental enrichment.

Given these potential benefits, it's important to explore innovative ways to make music experimentation and exploration more accessible and engaging, especially for young users. Addressing this challenge, this project explores how a tangible hardware interface can empower users to experiment with music and cultivate intrinsic motivation for learning through curiosity-driven, playful, and exploratory interactions.

By adopting an iterative design process, the project aims to examine whether such an interface can promote positive user experiences and foster a lasting interest in music. This involves working closely with the target group to collect user feedback and evaluate the Tangible User Interface's (TUI's) perceived benefits.

Further research in this domain is essential, as many children may not initially engage with music due to its perceived complexity or the lack of readily available, intuitive tools. Traditional approaches often present a steep learning curve, requiring significant time and effort before a child can experience the joy of musical discovery #cite(<mcpherson_music_2018>, supplement: [ch. 7 & 8]). By developing an alternative TUI, this project seeks to gain insights into how technology can support inclusive, intrinsically motivating @ryan_self-determination_2000 experiences with music. The aim is to nurture a fundamental love for music and experimentation, which may, in turn, drive children towards further musical engagement, including formal education or even musical creation.

The project involves working closely with the target group to collect user feedback, and evaluate the tool's perceived benefits.

Further research in this domain is essential, as traditional music education often presents high barriers to entry; such as the need for formal instruction, access to expensive instruments, and rigid teaching methods that may not resonate with all learners. By developing an alternative, Tangible User Interface (TUI), this project seeks to gain insights into how technology can support inclusive, intrinsically motivating @ryan_self-determination_2000 learning experiences in music creation.
