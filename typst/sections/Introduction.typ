= Introduction <chap:Introduction>
Music creation and engagement have been shown to have a range of positive effects on cognitive and emotional development in children. Studies indicate that exposure to music can enhance general intelligence, spatial reasoning, fine motor coordination, literacy skills and self-perception @hallam_power_2010 @jaschke_music_2013. These findings highlight the value of music not only as a form of artistic expression but also as a powerful tool for developmental enrichment. 

Given these potential benefits, it is important to explore innovative ways to make music creation and exploration more accessible and engaging– especially for young users.

In response to this challenge, this project investigates how the design of a _tangible hardware interface can facilitate music creation through curiosity-driven, playful and exploratory interactions_. By adopting an iterative design process, the project aims to examine whether such an interface can promote positive user experiences, and foster a lasting interest in music creation. The project involves working closely with the target group to collect user feedback, and evaluating the tool's perceived benefits.

Further research in this domain is essential, as traditional music education often presents high barriers to entry; such as the need for formal instruction, access to expensive instruments, and rigid teaching methods that may not resonate with all learners. By developing an alternative, tangible interface, this project seeks to gain insights into how technology can support inclusive, intrinsically motivating @ryan_self-determination_2000 learning experiences in music creation.
