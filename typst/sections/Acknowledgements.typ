We also extend our thanks to lecturer Roberto de Nóbrega for his consistent availability and willingness to assist when encountering problems, even outside of regular hours. His genuine interest in the project and encouragement throughout the process were greatly appreciated and highly motivating.

Lastly, we would like to thank Teknologiskolen and Rosengårdskolen for their collaboration, enabling us to test our prototypes with the target group. The feedback obtained through this collaboration was instrumental in shaping the final design and functionality of the prototypes.
