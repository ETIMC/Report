At the start of the project period, it was decided to create a project revolving around music, experimentation, exploration, and tangibility. To further narrow down the different possible subjects, an idea generation session utilizing the brainstorming method #text(red)[cite!] was conducted, using Figma Jamboard #text(red)[cite!] as its medium (@fig:FigmaIdeaGeneration). Various ideas were explored, and the most interesting ideas were as follows: 

+ Modular blocks with magnets that can be attached together to make a music-piece.
  - Could be a cooperative experience where more than one person decides the placement of a block in the system.
  - Physical interaction by placement of blocks, could use speed (or other physical interactions) as a variable in how the music will play when blocks are connected.
+ Cooperative modules for experimenting with rhythm- and music-making with flexibility by utilizing NFC cards for easy sound experimentation
  - Possibly integrating a gyroscope in a module to decide pitch or some other variables.
  - Could possibly both be used by singular children but also together by connecting the modules. This could possible foster cooperative learning while still maintaining engagement for the singular user.
  - By assigning each student to an instrument (module) the product could be used during collective music classes in primary school. This would lower the requirements for the music teacher while still allowing creative musical exploration for the children.
  - The modules can be designed to somewhat resemble their "real" musical counterparts, possibly inspiring children to learn a real musical instrument, and possibly provide near-transfer #text(red)[cite!].
+ "Piano" on the floor where children must step on it to create music pieces.
+ LED screens with interactive 'faces' that jump out of joy when the music is placed. (could be used in all of the different ideas)
+ Classic piano roll where different modules can be attached. 

The second idea, cooperative modules for music experimentation utilizing an NFC reader, with a target group of 9 to 12-year-olds, was selected as the basis for the project.
