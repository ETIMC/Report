The project aimed to explore how a tangible hardware interface could empower young users to experiment with music and cultivate intrinsic motivation for learning music through curiosity-driven, playful and exploratory interactions. The objective was to address the inherent complexities and barriers-to-entry often associated with traditional music engagement, and to create an alternative that fosters a fundamental love for music and experimentation.

Through an iterative design process involving close collaboration with the target group, the final prototype, a modular physical Controller utilizing NFC cards, buttons and potentiometers, successfully embodied these aims. User testing consistently revealed that children found the interface intuitive and enjoyable, particularly in collaborative settings. The system provided a hands-on and inviting pathway to musical exploration, demonstrating that tangible interfaces can effectively lower initial barriers to music engagement and promote positive user experiences.

While the prototype shows strong potential for nurturing a lasting interest in music, the scope of user testing presented a limitation. Most test sessions were short and involved a small group of participants, restricting insight into sustained engagement and long-term impact on musical interest or skill development. As such, it remains challenging to assess whether the system could support meaningful, ongoing musical interest over time.

In summary, this project presents a viable and engaging alternative to conventional music learning tools, highlighting the value of tangible design in promoting inclusive, curiosity-driven, and intrinsically motivating experiences with music. However, to fully evaluate the long-term benefits and accurately measure the sustained desire to learn music, more extensive studies are needed with a bigger group of participants over an extended period.
