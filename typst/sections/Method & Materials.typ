The project employed an iterative @fullerton_game_2019, user-centered design approach @sharp_interaction_2019, in which features were continuously refined and added based on user feedback gathered during multiple stages of prototype development.

Testing was primarily conducted with the target group, defined as children aged 9-12. This age range was selected based on previous studies that indicate the benefits of music interaction at a young age #cite(<mcpherson_music_2018>, supplement: [ch. 1]). The testing methodology integrated the think-aloud method #cite(<sharp_interaction_2019>, supplement: [p. 296]), A/B testing #cite(<sharp_interaction_2019>, supplement: [ch. 2]), and unstructured interviews #cite(<sharp_interaction_2019>, supplement: [ch. 8]). These formats were chosen for their adaptability, which helped mitigate cognitive overload @sweller_cognitive_2011 among participants. All testing sessions were conducted in Danish. Consequently, all participant quotes presented in this report have been translated from Danish to English. While every effort has been made to preserve the original meaning, some quotes may appear fragmented or imprecise due to the informal nature of children's speech and the challenges of direct translation.

Visual Studio Code @noauthor_visual_nodate was selected as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the project. Its use facilitated seamless development with CircuitPython @adafruit_circuitpython_nodate and provided direct access to the Picos' Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for effective debugging. Furthermore, KiCad @noauthor_kicad_nodate was used to design the circuitry schematics and the custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layouts. KiCad was chosen based on its open-source nature, flexibility, and its capability to produce precise schematics and fabrication-ready PCB designs.

The enclosures were designed using Fusion @noauthor_autodesk_nodate, a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool ideal for precise 3D modeling. Once the designs were finalized, the parts were prepared in Bambu Studio @bambu_lab_software_2025 and printed on a Bambu Lab P1S 3D printer @bambu_lab_bambu_nodate, ensuring high-quality and efficient fabrication. Multiple prints were required to refine the various components.

Images for the display were produced using Aseprite #cite(<igara_studio_aseprite_2025>), a tool suited for pixelart creation. This application was selected due to its ability to export compatible files, precise scaling for the display's resolution, and prior familiarity with the software. Additionally, Inkscape @inkscape_inkscape_2025, a free and open-source vector graphic design tool, was used to create the chassis decorations. This choice was driven by the initial plan to produce vinyl stickers, which required .SVG files. Inkscape was chosen over other vector design tools for its accessibility and beginner friendly interface.

To support potential replication of the final prototype or for further development, a bill of materials is included as an appendix (@app:bom).
