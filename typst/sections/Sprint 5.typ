- Potentiometer
- Lid with sprint 4 design
- Ny bund inkl. ny standoffs og NFC modifikationer (stoerrelse og LDR/LED)
  - Ny sider (især NFC side) printet på andet led = svært at sætte fast


There was then made a new side, with the same opening, but with more rounded edges. When it was printed, it was printed on the side and therefore did not need to print support inside the hole. The side was more difficult to get placed in the box, because of the way it was printed.

== Testing
The last round of user testing was conducted at Rosengårdskolen and involved six individual participants from the 5th grade here, three had participated in the test during Sprint 4. Each session lasted approximately seven and a half minutes.

During this test, a functional prototype was presented (@fig:sprint4setup). However, as previously discussed in #text(red)[reference section yippie], issues with the PCB configuration prevented the potentiometers from functioning correctly during this session. The test employed A/B testing, Think Aloud methodology, and unstructured interviews.

- Læg vægt på der er to controllers til i den her test!
