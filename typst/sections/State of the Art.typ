There exist many other products to gather inspiration from in the creative tangible MIDI controller space, though most of are focused on professional or hobbyist musicians. Companies like #cite(<noauthor_teenage_2025>, form: "prose") produce multiple products like the _Pocket operator_ @noauthor_pocket_nodate and the _OP-1_ @noauthor_op1_nodate. Both of these products contain both buttons and potentiometers for letting their users musically express themselves. Furthermore, their products often have displays with creative, engaging and funny animations reflecting their user's interaction with it, and they are completely self-contained, requiring no external computer with special music software. However, these products are not created with children, learning or education in mind. This is most obvious looking at the pricing for the latest iteration of the OP-1, costing over almost 2000#sym.euro @noauthor_op1_nodate-1, which makes it not very accessible for children wanting to experiment with music. The same tendency is seen with other products. MIDI controllers, like the _Maschine_ @noauthor_native_nodate also have potentiometers and pads for playing music and experimenting with sounds. This device, however, is more focused on creating entire musical pieces and requires the beforementioned external computer with special musical software and still has a price tag of almost 600#sym.euro. Native Instruments also offer a self-contained version, the _Maschine+_, but that costs double the amount of the regular version @noauthor_native_nodate, once again not being in economic range or suitable for children wanting to experiment with music. Another smart musical device is the _Roland MC-101_ @corporation_roland_nodate. This device also contains potentiometers, buttons and even faders for experimenting with sounds and musical compositions. This device does not require an external computer and is even battery-powered. However, the device itself is like Maschine more focused on creating entire songs than experimentation and also costs over 500#sym.euro.

Apart from commercial solutions, there do exist creative tools affording musical experimentation and interaction. _Noteput_ @noauthor_jonas_nodate is a physical interface in which users put models of musical notes on top of a projected note sheet allowing users to experiment with different notes, time signatures and even different clefs. This device promotes engagement, letting users experiment with music, while trying to combine as many senses as possible to achieve the best learning results @noauthor_jonas_nodate.

#cite(<chen_humming_2019>, form: "prose") describes how an AI-based tangible hand-crank-music-box combined with a tablet app allowed children ages 4-6 to experiment with music. The box allowed children to play a song by turning the crank, while the insertion of different acrylic cards afforded changing the songs timbre. The paper also describes how the children cooperatively assigned different interactions to each other fostering engagement. Even more interesting was it when the children's' parents were present as the children wanted to include them also. By collaborating, the adults would guide and inspire the children to use the music box in different creative ways. This underlines both the importance of tangibility and the effect that cooperation can have in heightening user engagement and enjoyment.

#cite(<sabuncuoglu_tangible_2020>, form: "prose") shows the development of an accessible music platform for visually impaired children. Among other things it uses NFC stickers and a custom developed Android app to convert physically arranged wooden blocks into a melody. While naturally focusing on accessibility, the paper illustrates how tangibility and NFC technology can be utilized to create an engaging product that makes previously unavailable technology and experiences available to users with disabilities.

The evolving field of TUIs for music creation offers intuitive and engaging experiences.

While many commercial tangible MIDI controllers exist, they typically target professional or hobbyist musicians rather than children or educational settings. Products like Teenage Engineering's _Pocket Operator_ and _OP-1_ offer self-contained, expressive musical control with buttons and potentiometers @teenage_engineering_pocket_2025 @teenage_engineering_op1_2025. Their engaging visual displays and lack of external software requirements are notable. However, their high cost (e.g., OP-1 at nearly 2000#sym.euro @teenage_engineering_op1_2025-1) makes them inaccessible for casual experimentation by children. Similarly, Native Instruments' _Maschine_ (around 600#sym.euro) and _Maschine+_ (1200#sym.euro) @native_instruments_native_2025, and the Roland _MC-101_ (over 500#sym.euro) @thomann_roland_2025, while feature-rich, are primarily designed for full song creation rather than simple experimentation, and often require external computers.

Beyond commercial offerings, various creative tools facilitate musical experimentation. _Noteput_ @heuer_noteput_2010 is a physical interface where users arrange note models on a projected sheet to explore different musical parameters, promoting multi-sensory engagement for learning. #cite(<chen_humming_2019>, form: "prose") introduced an AI-based hand-crank music box and tablet app for young children, demonstrating how tangible interaction and cooperative play (especially with parental involvement) enhance engagement and enjoyment. #cite(<sabuncuoglu_tangible_2020>, form: "prose") developed an accessible music platform for visually impaired children, utilizing Near-Field Communication (NFC) stickers and wooden blocks to create melodies, highlighting how tangibility and technology can open up musical experiences for users with disabilities.

Key research contributions include #cite(<newton-dunn_block_2003>, form: "prose"), a system employing 26 physical blocks as an input device for a polyrhythmic sequencer. This TUI creates a tangible and visual language, enabling users of all musical backgrounds to explore and collaborate intuitively, even across networked systems. #cite(<palaigeorgiou_orchestrating_2018>, form: "prose") orchestrates tangible music interfaces for in-classroom learning through a fairy tale narrative. This approach allows novice students to compose and perform soundtracks for episodic stories, fostering meaningful engagement within short sessions. #cite(<ning_music_2011>, form: "prose") is a tabletop application designed for intuitive music composition and playback by both novices and trained musicians, emphasizing the value of human-computer interaction in fostering creativity.

These TUIs inherently connect with Self-Determination Theory (SDT) @ryan_self-determination_2000. SDT posits that humans possess three innate psychological needs crucial for intrinsic motivation and well-being:
- Autonomy: The desire for choice and self-initiation in one's actions.
- Competence: The need to feel capable and effective in mastering challenges.
- Relatedness: The longing for connection and belonging with others.

When these needs are satisfied, motivation and psychological growth are enhanced. In TUIs, supporting autonomy (e.g., free exploration), competence (e.g., clear feedback), and relatedness (e.g., collaborative features) can significantly boost user engagement, learning, and satisfaction. SDT thus offers a valuable framework for evaluating the motivational impact of tangible music creation tools.
