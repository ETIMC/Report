There exist many other products to gather inspiration from in the creative tangible MIDI controller space, though most of are focused on professional or hobbyist musicians. Companies like #cite(<noauthor_teenage_2025>, form: "prose") produce multiple products like the _Pocket operator_ @noauthor_pocket_nodate and the _OP-1_ @noauthor_op1_nodate. Both of these products contain both buttons and potentiometers for letting their users musically express themselves. Furthermore, their products often have displays with creative, engaging and funny animations reflecting their user's interaction with it, and they are completely self-contained, requiring no external computer with special music software. However, these products are not created with children, learning or education in mind. This is most obvious looking at the pricing for the latest iteration of the OP-1, costing over almost 2000#sym.euro @noauthor_op1_nodate-1, which makes it not very accessible for children wanting to experiment with music. The same tendency is seen with other products. MIDI controllers, like the _Maschine_ @noauthor_native_nodate also have potentiometers and pads for playing music and experimenting with sounds. This device, however, is more focused on creating entire musical pieces and requires the beforementioned external computer with special musical software and still has a price tag of almost 600#sym.euro. Native Instruments also offer a self-contained version, the _Maschine+_, but that costs double the amount of the regular version @noauthor_native_nodate, once again not being in economic range or suitable for children wanting to experiment with music. Another smart musical device is the _Roland MC-101_ @corporation_roland_nodate. This device also contains potentiometers, buttons and even faders for experimenting with sounds and musical compositions. This device does not require an external computer and is even battery-powered. However, the device itself is like Maschine more focused on creating entire songs than experimentation and also costs over 500#sym.euro.

Apart from commercial solutions, there do exist creative tools affording musical experimentation and interaction. _Noteput_ @noauthor_jonas_nodate is a physical interface in which users put models of musical notes on top of a projected note sheet allowing users to experiment with different notes, time signatures and even different clefs. This device promotes engagement, letting users experiment with music, while trying to combine as many senses as possible to achieve the best learning results @noauthor_jonas_nodate.

#cite(<chen_humming_2019>, form: "prose") describes how an AI-based tangible hand-crank-music-box combined with a tablet app allowed children ages 4-6 to experiment with music. The box allowed children to play a song by turning the crank, while the insertion of different acrylic cards afforded changing the songs timbre. The paper also describes how the children cooperatively assigned different interactions to each other fostering engagement. Even more interesting was it when the children's' parents were present as the children wanted to include them also. By collaborating, the adults would guide and inspire the children to use the music box in different creative ways. This underlines both the importance of tangibility and the effect that cooperation can have in heightening user engagement and enjoyment.
