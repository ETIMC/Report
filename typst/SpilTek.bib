	abstract = {An analysis of over 750 quests from four popular {RPGs} (Eve Online, World of Warcraft, Everquest, and Vanguard: Saga of Heroes) reveals that {RPG} quests appear to share a common structure. We propose a classification of {RPG} quests based on this structure, and describe a prototype quest generator based on that classification. Our aim is to procedurally generate quests that are complex, multi-leveled, and plausible to players of {RPGs}. We analyze a nontrivial quest from Everquest and one from our prototype quest generator for comparison.},

However, the results of studies within similar cognitive domains are found to be inconclusive or contradictory. These differences can be traced back to the analytical methods used, differences in the forms of music education studied and differences in neural activation during the processing of these tasks. In order to gain a better picture of the relationships involved, a literature survey was performed in leading databases, such as {PubMed}/{MedLine}, {psychINFO}, {ScienceDirect}, Embase, {ERIC}, {ASSIA} and Jstor from January 2001 to January 2013. All studies included, concerned the far transfer from music education to other cognitive skills in children aged 4–13 years as compared with controls. These studies were independently selected and their quality was assessed by two authors. This systematic review shows the need to address methodological and analytical questions in greater detail. There is a general need to unify methods used in music education research. Furthermore, the hypothesis that intellectual skills, such as mathematics, reading, writing and intelligence can be divided into sub-functions, needs to be examined as one approach to the problems considered here. When this has been done, detailed analysis of cognitive transfer from music education to other disciplines should become possible.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous music is a relatively new research area which seeks ways to involve novices in music learning, playing and improvisation. Despite the ambitious goals, ubiquitous music is still unknown territory in schools. In this study, we have tried to identify whether ubiquitous music environments can enable novice music students to participate in meaningful learning activities in a short period of time inside the school classroom. The proposed approach, named {ImproviSchool}, consists of two basic elements: a) a set of tangible music interfaces, and b) a fairy tale for which the students are asked to compose a soundtrack. The fairy tale is broken down into smaller episodes and for each one, the students are asked to compose a music score and dramatize the narration. At the end, students have to perform their creations in front of an audience. The whole process is aimed to last only two sessions of 2 school hours. {ImproviSchool} was applied in two 4th grade school classrooms of 15 students each, with the aim of evaluating both the set of the music tangible interfaces and the instructional approach. Data were collected through questionnaires and focus groups with the students as well as an interview with the music teacher. Students found the Bmusic images{\textasciicircum} for playing and composing music easy, attractive, expressive, and enjoyable, and within a very short time frame, they created their own musical arrangements. Students showed enthusiastic with what they had produced and with their performance while at the same time achieving music learning objectives regarding instrument recognition, rhythm, pitch, volume and execution style. The realization of such a demanding activity in just 2 sessions shows that ubiquitous music can radically change the way in which musical learning evolves in schools.},

	abstract = {As the world continue to embrace motion recognition technology in recent years, it had also open up a new method for performing and learning music with motion recognition devices. In 2013, Leap Motion was released. It is a programmable motion recognition device, ticking the requirement needed by the Author to design a new software and application for music education. This research focus on the the process of creating a new software that will use the Leap Motion technology for music education class at elementary school. The research is meant to develop alternative ways in teaching music and performing for children, not to replace the traditional teaching method. The paper will talk about the whole experience of designing, implementing, and testing the usage of Leap Motion for music education. The research consist of two phase. The first phase is the music software design. It had 2 main program. The first program is the performance application, students can use both of their hands to perform music through the software, limited only to monophonic melody. The right hand will be positioned to control the pitch, on a one octave diatonic scale. The left hand will be positioned to control the note on and note off. Through the combination of these hand position, the student will be able to play one note at a time, a mono sine wave sound. The second program is the game application, student can practice their hand movement and carry out their music practice with this music application that's designed to mimic note scrolling music video games like the one found on commercial video games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero. A series of notes can be seen on the software user interface and they can practice to position their hand at the right moment to perform the right melody of the music piece. This music software is aimed toward first and second grade of elementary school student as it can be devised as a tool to help the student to learn melody and rhythm in music. The second phase of the research is a field study to measure the effectiveness of teaching this new method of music education through survey. The survey conclude that the there's still a long way to go to create an ideal motion recognition music based application. Through this survey we have collected data that consist of the the positives and negative opinion on the students experience with the software.},

We then introduce the game design and implementation of the Music Pattern. Lastly, an early user study and a discussion are included.},

It explains how musical skills may transfer to other activities if the processes involved are similar. It explores the evidence relating to the impact of musical skills on language development, literacy, numeracy, measures of intelligence, general attainment, creativity, fine motor co-ordination, concentration, self-confidence, emotional sensitivity, social skills, team work, self-discipline, and relaxation. It suggests that the positive effects of engagement with music on personal and social development only occur if it is an enjoyable and rewarding experience. This has implications for the quality of the teaching.},

In this research the researchers observed that technology had played an important role in many of the events recorded. Observations, in the form of two Learning Stories, are presented to illustrate the use and role of technology in these recorded events. Socio/cultural theory was used to frame the research design and data consisted of direct observations, field notes, photographs, video and interviews. Analysis focused on children's musical play and an awareness of the role of technology in the musical activities observed. Within the theoretical paradigm adopted technology was viewed as a cultural, historical and social tool. Technology, as a mediating tool, was found to be connected to children's learning with the capacity to enhance and enrich their understanding of events and relationships.},
