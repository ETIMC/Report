We propose a classification of {RPG} quests based on this structure, and describe a prototype quest generator based on that classification. Our aim is to procedurally generate quests that are complex, multi-leveled, and plausible to players of {RPGs}. We analyze a nontrivial quest from Everquest and one from our prototype quest generator for comparison.},

Drawing on a combined 35 years of design and teaching experience, Colleen Macklin and John Sharp link the concepts and elements of play to the practical tasks of game design. Using full-color examples, they reveal how real game designers think and work, and illuminate the amazing expressive potential of great game design.Focusing on practical details, this book guides you from idea to prototype to playtest and fully realized design. You’ll walk through conceiving and creating a game’s inner workings, including its core actions, themes, and especially its play experience. Step by step, you’ll assemble every component of your “videogame,” creating practically every kind of play: from cooperative to competitive, from chance-based to role-playing, and everything in between.Macklin and Sharp believe that games are for everyone, and game design is an exciting art form with a nearly unlimited array of styles, forms, and messages. Cutting across traditional platform and genre boundaries, they help you find inspiration wherever it exists.Games, Design and Play is for all game design students, and for beginning-to-intermediate-level game professionals, especially independent game designers. Bridging the gaps between imagination and production, it will help you craft outstanding designs for incredible play experiences!Coverage includes:Understanding core elements of play design: actions, goals, rules, objects, playspace, and {playersMastering} “tools” such as constraint, interaction, goals, challenges, strategy, chance, decision, storytelling, and {contextComparing} types of play and player {experiencesConsidering} the demands videogames make on {playersEstablishing} a game’s design {valuesCreating} design documents, schematics, and tracking {spreadsheetsCollaborating} in teams on a shared design {visionBrainstorming} and conceptualizing {designsUsing} prototypes to realize and playtest {designsImproving} designs by making the most of playtesting {feedbackKnowing} when a design is ready for {productionLearning} the rules so you can break them!},

However, the results of studies within similar cognitive domains are found to be inconclusive or contradictory. These differences can be traced back to the analytical methods used, differences in the forms of music education studied and differences in neural activation during the processing of these tasks. In order to gain a better picture of the relationships involved, a literature survey was performed in leading databases, such as {PubMed}/{MedLine}, {psychINFO}, {ScienceDirect}, Embase, {ERIC}, {ASSIA} and Jstor from January 2001 to January 2013. All studies included, concerned the far transfer from music education to other cognitive skills in children aged 4–13 years as compared with controls. These studies were independently selected and their quality was assessed by two authors. This systematic review shows the need to address methodological and analytical questions in greater detail. There is a general need to unify methods used in music education research. Furthermore, the hypothesis that intellectual skills, such as mathematics, reading, writing and intelligence can be divided into sub-functions, needs to be examined as one approach to the problems considered here. When this has been done, detailed analysis of cognitive transfer from music education to other disciplines should become possible.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous music is a relatively new research area which seeks ways to involve novices in music learning, playing and improvisation. Despite the ambitious goals, ubiquitous music is still unknown territory in schools. In this study, we have tried to identify whether ubiquitous music environments can enable novice music students to participate in meaningful learning activities in a short period of time inside the school classroom. The proposed approach, named {ImproviSchool}, consists of two basic elements: a) a set of tangible music interfaces, and b) a fairy tale for which the students are asked to compose a soundtrack. The fairy tale is broken down into smaller episodes and for each one, the students are asked to compose a music score and dramatize the narration. At the end, students have to perform their creations in front of an audience. The whole process is aimed to last only two sessions of 2 school hours. {ImproviSchool} was applied in two 4th grade school classrooms of 15 students each, with the aim of evaluating both the set of the music tangible interfaces and the instructional approach. Data were collected through questionnaires and focus groups with the students as well as an interview with the music teacher. Students found the Bmusic images{\textasciicircum} for playing and composing music easy, attractive, expressive, and enjoyable, and within a very short time frame, they created their own musical arrangements. Students showed enthusiastic with what they had produced and with their performance while at the same time achieving music learning objectives regarding instrument recognition, rhythm, pitch, volume and execution style. The realization of such a demanding activity in just 2 sessions shows that ubiquitous music can radically change the way in which musical learning evolves in schools.},

However, programming tools for visually impaired children are still scarce. We developed an affordable and accessible tangible music platform for visually impaired children that aims to teach the basics of programming through music creation. By ordering the tangible blocks in an algorithmic structure, the children can create a melody. The physical and conceptual design of the system was developed with the help of visually impaired developers. We conducted a user study with fourteen visually impaired middle school children to observe their interactions with the prototype. In this paper, we present our design, provide several {TUI} design considerations for students with low to zero sight, and discuss the results of our user study and future directions.},

	abstract = {As the world continue to embrace motion recognition technology in recent years, it had also open up a new method for performing and learning music with motion recognition devices. In 2013, Leap Motion was released. It is a programmable motion recognition device, ticking the requirement needed by the Author to design a new software and application for music education. This research focus on the the process of creating a new software that will use the Leap Motion technology for music education class at elementary school. The research is meant to develop alternative ways in teaching music and performing for children, not to replace the traditional teaching method. The paper will talk about the whole experience of designing, implementing, and testing the usage of Leap Motion for music education. The research consist of two phase. The first phase is the music software design. It had 2 main program. The first program is the performance application, students can use both of their hands to perform music through the software, limited only to monophonic melody. The right hand will be positioned to control the pitch, on a one octave diatonic scale. The left hand will be positioned to control the note on and note off. Through the combination of these hand position, the student will be able to play one note at a time, a mono sine wave sound. The second program is the game application, student can practice their hand movement and carry out their music practice with this music application that's designed to mimic note scrolling music video games like the one found on commercial video games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero. A series of notes can be seen on the software user interface and they can practice to position their hand at the right moment to perform the right melody of the music piece. This music software is aimed toward first and second grade of elementary school student as it can be devised as a tool to help the student to learn melody and rhythm in music. The second phase of the research is a field study to measure the effectiveness of teaching this new method of music education through survey. The survey conclude that the there's still a long way to go to create an ideal motion recognition music based application. Through this survey we have collected data that consist of the the positives and negative opinion on the students experience with the software.},

The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.  The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.  The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

Developments in music software designed assisted instruction are placed in six categories: drill-and-practice, flexible practice, guided instruction, games, exploratory, and creative. The article continues by offering examples of commercial software from these categories that are appropriate for young children. Screen shots of each program are offered, together with comments about how each title works. Research on the young child and music technology is included, with references to work done in and outside of music education. The article ends with the notion that teachers are always the key to quality instruction in music and music technology is only a tool in the process.},
